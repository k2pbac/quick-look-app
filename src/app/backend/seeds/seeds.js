Each Popsicle Cyclone Cherry, Lemon & Blue Raspberry Ice Pop contains only 70 calories. They are also made with colours and flavours from natural sources, making them the perfect frozen dessert.

Popsicle Ice Snacks have been a treasured treat for over 100 years, and they remain Canada’s favourite ice pop. The very first Popsicle® ice pop was created way back in 1905 by an 11-year-old named Frank Epperson. That’s right, Popsicle was invented by a kid. After a long day of play Frank went inside, but left his cup of soda with the stirring stick still in it out on the porch. The night got cold, and when Frank went outside the next morning he found his drink frozen like an icicle. Frank called his invention the “Epsicle.” It was a hit with the kids at school, and later with his kids who called it “Pop’s sicle.” The name was catchy and the treat was delicious, so Frank patented it in 1923 to share his frozen Popsicle ice pops with the world. A lot has happened since 1905, when the first Popsicle ice pop was made. Visit www.popsicle.com/ca to check out all the ice pop varieties across the Popsicle brands.
